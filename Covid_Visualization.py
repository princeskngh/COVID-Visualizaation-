It is quiet astonishing that cases went up and up despite a proper lockdown.
Some points to which it can be attributed are:
1) Migrant workers moving in masses.
2) Many religious gatherings, including weddings
3) People not obeying the prescribed guidelines appropriately.


Unfortunately on 1st june unlock was announced, and the number of cases just kept going on and on.
